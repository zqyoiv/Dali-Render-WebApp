# Summary: Timestamp Tracking & Auto-Cleanup Implementation

## What Was Added

### ✅ Object Creation Timestamps
Yes, the system now records timestamps for every object when it's created!

**Implementation:**
- Added `objectTimestamps: {}` to `GardenData` singleton state
- Timestamps are automatically recorded when objects are added (any method: single, batch, WebSocket)
- Timestamps are automatically deleted when objects are removed
- Timestamps are included in all `getGardenState()` responses

### ✅ Auto-Cleanup After 5 Minutes of Inactivity

**Behavior:**
- ⏱️ 5-minute inactivity timer starts/resets on any object add/remove
- 🗑️ When timer expires: removes **oldest half** of objects
- 🔄 Timer resets on ANY activity (add/remove operations)
- ⏹️ Timer stops if garden is empty

**Example:**
```
10 objects → 5 min inactivity → removes 5 oldest
7 objects → 5 min inactivity → removes 3 oldest
3 objects → 5 min inactivity → removes 1 oldest
1 object → 5 min inactivity → no removal
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `object-manage/object-manager.js`

**Added:**
- `inactivityTimer` - Timer variable
- `INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT` - 5 minute constant
- `resetInactivityTimer()` - Manages timer lifecycle
- `removeOldestHalf()` - Cleanup function
- `objectTimestamps` field to `GardenData`

**Updated:**
- `updateStateMetadata()` - Now resets timer on every state change
- `addObject()` - Tracks timestamp, removes timestamp on duplicates/displacements
- `removeObject()` - Removes timestamp
- `clearGarden()` - Clears all timestamps
- `addObjectsBatch()` - Tracks timestamps for all added objects
- `getGardenState()` - Returns timestamps
- Module exports - Added `removeOldestHalf`

**All timestamp deletion points:**
- Duplicate removal
- Forced displacement removal
- Oldest removal (capacity management)
- Manual object removal
- Garden clear (batch and single)
- Auto-cleanup removal

### 2. `app.js`

**Added:**
- New endpoint: `POST /cleanup-oldest` - Manually trigger cleanup

**Existing endpoints automatically updated:**
- `GET /garden-state` - Now includes `objectTimestamps`
- All other endpoints work seamlessly with timestamp tracking

### 3. Documentation

**Created:**
- `documentation/timestamp-autocleanup.md` - Complete feature documentation

## API Usage

### Get Garden State with Timestamps
```bash
curl http://localhost:4000/garden-state
```

Response includes:
```json
{
  "gardenState": {
    "objectTimestamps": {
      "1": 1699234567890,
      "3": 1699234568123
    }
  }
}
```

### Manually Trigger Cleanup
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/cleanup-oldest
```

## Testing the Feature

### Test Auto-Cleanup:
1. Start the server: `node app.js`
2. Add some objects: `curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/add/1`
3. Wait 5 minutes
4. Watch console logs for: `⏰ 5 minutes of inactivity detected`
5. Verify half the objects were removed

### Test Manual Cleanup:
```bash
# Add objects
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/add/1
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/add/3
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/add/16
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/add/18

# Check state
curl http://localhost:4000/garden-state

# Trigger cleanup
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/cleanup-oldest

# Verify 2 objects removed
curl http://localhost:4000/garden-state
```

## Console Log Examples

When auto-cleanup triggers:
```
⏰ 5 minutes of inactivity detected - triggering auto-cleanup
🗑️ Auto-cleanup: Removing oldest 5 of 10 objects
✅ Auto-cleanup complete: Removed 5 objects. Garden now has 5 objects
```

When objects are added:
```
🔄 Garden State Updated - Version: 12, Objects: 8/22
```

## Configuration

To change the timeout duration, edit `object-manager.js`:
```javascript
const INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT = 5 * 60 * 1000; // 5 minutes (in milliseconds)
```

## Key Features

✅ Timestamps are recorded for every object  
✅ Auto-cleanup after 5 minutes of no activity  
✅ Removes oldest half of objects  
✅ Timer resets on any add/remove activity  
✅ Manual cleanup endpoint available  
✅ All operations send proper OSC messages  
✅ Timestamps included in all state responses  
✅ Fully integrated with existing functionality  

## No Breaking Changes

All existing API endpoints and WebSocket functionality continue to work exactly as before. The timestamp tracking and auto-cleanup are transparent additions that enhance the system without breaking any existing features.
